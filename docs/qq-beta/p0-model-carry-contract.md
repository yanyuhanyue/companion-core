# Retained UNKNOWN model liability handoff

Core owns `companion_delivery_protocol/model_carry.py`, the Core API, configuration,
authority, original budget journal, cumulative budget and offline controller. Bridge
owns `owner_handoff.py`, its CLI and journal reader. No other Bridge files are owned
by the Core slice. Base is main `90bc5b3`; factory is parked separately.

The frozen read endpoint is `POST /internal/v1/owner-authority/model-carry-receipt`,
using the existing Bridge Bearer credential and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
Its exact request is `{authority, carry_sha256, successor_policy_sha256}`. Authority
is the stopped ACTIVE AuthorityRef v2, not its STOP revision. The two digests must
match the original journal-backed prepared carry. It is readable only at the exact
STOP successor (r+1) or the exact ACTIVE successor (r+2, matching policy), same grant
and restore generation. The immutable response is validated by `model_carry.receipt`.
All fields and bounds are defined in that shared dependency-free module.

The first migration returns `owner_model_unknown_carry_v1`, version 1, for the
original legacy authority. Later STOP/ACTIVE cycles reuse the exact successor
policy, paid approval, window, interval and full predecessor budget scope. Core
checks the uninterrupted native revision chain under that same grant and restore
generation. Every UNKNOWN must still have verified closure in the original journal;
an outstanding transport, pending send, changed approval, restore or missing
projection blocks activation. This continuation does not append another carry or
create a financial window. A cycle with only settled current inputs uses ordinary
Bridge `owner-handoff-prepare`; its historical carried facts remain in custody.

When the current authority has a locally closed UNKNOWN, the same endpoint returns
`owner_model_unknown_carry_v2`, version 2. It has all v1 field names plus
`origin_authority` and `local_closures`. `authority` identifies this cycle's stopped
ACTIVE ref and `core_stop_sha256` its immediate native STOP. `origin_authority`,
`carry_sha256`, `record_sha256`, `successor_policy_sha256` and `successor_window_id`
retain the original approved migration anchor. `inputs` includes every current
source linked by native job responsibility to the selected UNKNOWN requests,
including history sources. `request_ids` and `retained_micro_usd` cover those current
requests; historical migration liability remains separately retained.
`local_closures` is a sorted list of exact `{request_id, record_sha256}` pairs, one
per selected request. Each hash must identify that request's existing validated
`model_local_close` record under the current authority. In this explicit version,
`closed_executors_sha256` hashes `local_closures`; it is not a Docker exit claim.
There is no new journal control kind, remote attestation or financial record.

The v2 response is derived read-only from original custody at STOP r+1 or its exact
same-policy ACTIVE r+2. Bridge uses its existing carry prepare and handoff commands,
requires the same authenticated response before and after activation, and retains
the v2 proof inside the existing version-1 Bridge record wrappers. Shared validation
dispatches by the explicit kind/version. Original input-state booleans and prior
stored v1 receipts retain their existing meanings. In particular, local closure
never makes UNKNOWN settled or permits replay of its original logical request.

Hashes use existing wire `canonical`/`digest` (sorted compact UTF-8 JSON, SHA256).
`carry_sha256` hashes the Core-computed carry manifest; `record_sha256` is the
original budget journal record hash; `receipt_sha256` hashes the response excluding
itself. There is no new signature domain: authentication is the direct Core lookup,
as for existing input-state receipts. Existing signatures and STOP receipts retain
their exact meaning. No offline caller-supplied receipt substitutes for the lookup.

Bridge prepare requires its original exclusive stopped Spool, original Core STOP
confirmation (`quiescence_proven=false`), and a direct carry lookup. Ordinary inputs
continue through existing `terminal()`. Only listed nonterminal model inputs may
use `model_carry.carried(original_state,capture,receipt)`; retain the complete
original false terminal/true unsettled_model values in `OWNER_INPUT_CARRIED` data:
`{version:1, authority, event_id, input_state, carry_receipt}`. The new preparation
record kind is `OWNER_CARRY_HANDOFF_PREPARED`, with exact data
`{version:1, authority, core_stop, custody_sha256, carry_receipt}`. Ordinary
`OWNER_HANDOFF_PREPARED` remains unchanged. Include carried records and the carry
receipt in the existing custody digest. Re-fetch the same carry receipt after
building custody, and require exact equality with the first lookup before append.
The new CLI returns state `CARRY_HANDOFF_PREPARED`.
`verify/closed` validate stored carried evidence; preserve all original input refs,
source capture bytes, attempts, provider ACKs and reconciliation requirements.

Existing OWNER_REBOUND shape remains unchanged. For carry preparation its
successor must additionally have `policy_sha256 == receipt.successor_policy_sha256`.
The original same grant, revision r+2, generation, journal-ID, active Core check and
stop-marker rules continue to apply. No original tool state, input or model request
is retried. The original pending inbox may close locally after the explicit carried
record is durable, as ordinary prepare closes terminal inbox entries; no ACK is made.

Core errors are `OWNER_MODEL_CARRY_REQUIRED` (403),
`OWNER_MODEL_CARRY_CHANGED` (409), `OWNER_MODEL_CARRY_NOT_QUIESCENT` (409), or existing
budget custody/restore errors (503). Shape failures remain HTTP 422. Shared wire
validation raises `OWNER_MODEL_CARRY_RECEIPT_INVALID` or
`OWNER_MODEL_CARRY_INPUT_CHANGED`. Bridge must retain STOP on every failure.

Policy uses PaidModelApproval.concurrency_basis=`local_active_attempts_v2` and
OwnerGrantPolicy.unknown_carry_sha256. Optional fields are omitted for old policies.
The reviewed target has neither cumulative approval nor its runtime projection.
This urgent slice explicitly rejects either one with
`MODEL_CARRY_CUMULATIVE_UNSUPPORTED`; it does not change cumulative v1 behavior.
Cumulative v2 is deferred. Its later review must cover both overwrite directions
of OWNER_PAUSE/DELIVERY_UNCERTAIN versus UNKNOWN, and closure after later timeouts;
checking only the final displayed pause reason is insufficient.
Historical UNKNOWN and STARTED remain present. New window counters include the
predecessor's full budget scope; cumulative financial identities are never rewritten.

Integration order is original STOP -> real API/all-model-worker exits -> controlled
offline carry append -> new API only -> authenticated Bridge carry prepare -> exact
authority preview/activate -> Bridge handoff -> workers/new independent signed input
and real ACK, external transports mocked. Core provides the full prepared receipt
from the approved offline request, including the target policy hash. The deployment
controller verifies actual inspect/wait evidence before executing the offline command;
the product neither mounts docker.sock nor pretends the supplier stopped execution.

The original append-only budget journal retains only the successor policy and paid
contract hashes, not the private policy JSON. Activation checks those exact hashes.
It must not defeat native policy redaction or source erasure. `retained_micro_usd`
is the frozen original liability floor; later larger known responsibility remains
accounted by the original ledger. New v2 admissions reject any logical request
which already has UNKNOWN, including after local closure. A new independently
authenticated input has a different native job/logical identity.

## Controlled operator execution

Use the reviewed Python environment on the trusted deployment host, with the same
absolute DB, journal and erasure paths as the frozen custody. This is not an API or
worker container permission. If that environment or path binding is unavailable,
stop at preflight; do not mount docker.sock into the product or rewrite custody paths.

First collect the reviewed deployment inventory before STOP, retaining the full
container ID, image ID, source artifact SHA256, service, original process ID and
StartedAt. After the original Core and Bridge STOP, the deployment operator disables
restart for those exact retired containers and stops/waits for all of them. The
controller independently performs local `inspect`, full project `ps -a --no-trunc`,
`wait` and a second `inspect`. It refuses a missing API/worker, omitted executor,
running/restarting process, changed image/start identity or enabled restart policy.
Existing OS worker locks are held while inspecting and committing native custody.
The private request's `executors` entries contain exactly `container_id`, `image_id`,
`source_sha256`, `service`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `process_id`.

The exact private request fields are `version=1`, `operation_id`,
`authorization_sha256`, `expected_head_sha256`, original `authority`,
`successor_window_id`, `manifest_sha256`, `successor_policy`, `executors`.
The new paid configuration is loaded separately through existing Settings. Both the
paid approval and owner authorization evidence must be new; all other limits,
prices, keys, permissions and original approval intervals remain unchanged.

```sh
python -m companion preview-model-carry --request PRIVATE_REQUEST --request-sha256 REVIEWED_SHA256
python -m companion carry-closed-model-attempts --request PRIVATE_REQUEST --request-sha256 REVIEWED_SHA256
```

Preview computes the exact manifest/digest for review and does not append a carry.
Fill that digest and the exact successor policy, then review the complete request
bytes before commit. The commit re-observes the real stopped executors and recomputes
the whole manifest; a caller cannot submit a list that omits an UNKNOWN or an amount.
Only the identical approved request can complete an interrupted journal/projection
commit; normal readers remain blocked. It fsyncs the existing record again before
restoring that exact projection and never replays a provider attempt.

These native Docker operations follow the primary CLI contracts:
[inspect](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/inspect/),
[wait](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/wait/) and
[container listing/filtering](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/ls/).

## Candidate image and migration boundary

The feature was authored on main `90bc5b3`; final integration normally inherits
main `6107b2d`, including its separately reviewed bounded animation preview. Relative
to the running c8 image, main also merged optional routed context limits and native
request planning/checkpoints; read-only context/activity inspection; Core-owned meme
asset/runtime/erasure support; backend cache-usage presence; the private temporary
backup staging fix; native image-transfer source-check repairs; and HTTP test tooling.
The image contains the previously merged console inspection code; this P0 adds no UI.

Schema `0047_meme_assets` is part of that base and must follow the original reviewed
init/migration procedure with a preserved latest backup. Its empty tables do not
authorize an asset import or ownership transfer. Keep `meme_catalog_owner=bridge`,
`meme_trusted_sources=[]`, and do not enable discovery/captioning or add paid meme
input approval as part of P0. Preserve the original disabled/absent Life shadow and
all existing owner permission scopes. Do not add `max_context_tokens`, routing or
token-counting approval; the optional new fields remain omitted at their defaults.
Native planning and the inherited source-check fixes are active code changes and
must not be represented as disabled by an invented feature flag. Their already
verified main evidence and the final combined native check accompany release review.

After a new control record is appended, old c8 is not a compatible journal reader.
Do not roll back to an old database or journal prefix: new responsibilities and the
84 microUSD UNKNOWN must remain. Stop/OFF on the new reader and forward repair are
the conservative rollback. Returning to old bytes requires proving that no new
responsibility or control record has crossed that boundary. Source retention and
original image expiry are never extended by this operation.
