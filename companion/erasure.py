"""Bounded module cleanup contract; the Ledger owns durability and coordination.

Each owner keeps its own SQL. Handlers receive the already resolved event closure,
must be idempotent, run in the caller's transaction, and must not commit, append a
Ledger record, send I/O or refund accounting. New persistent projections register
here with their source-evidence eraser; adding a name also requests one targeted
repair of older COMPLETE snapshots via the existing runtime_meta projection.

Diary projection resolution runs before memory/evidence removal and may return
readback event IDs. The handlers below retain their original order after that
phase. Unattributed summaries/traits/Outbox still use Ledger's conservative raw-
fact fallback on a new erasure, never on the one-time COMPLETE repair.
