"""Self interests and views rebuilt from actual completed reads and her own judgements.

Each independent completed self read is one experience; a judged Watch Ledger entry for the
same item is her local view of it. Interest engagement counts only reads she chose herself; a
link the owner sent is a starting point whose judgement still shapes her view. Views replay
the latest judged experiences in reading order, so new evidence can strengthen, weaken or
revise them, and each change keeps the experience that caused it. Nothing here is stored:
source erasure, expiry or an owner-withdrawn judgement changes the next rebuild, and a
restored backup replays the erasure ledger before it is read. Plans, Life choices and model
prose never count as experiences.
