"""Watch ledger: her own short judgement of each completed Bilibili, Heybox or goal read.

The life worker finds FETCHED/WATCHED observations that have no entry yet (a web page only
when it is the result of a completed goal step), records how
deep the read went (from the evidence, never from the model), and makes one paid
`watch_review` call per entry for a rating, a one-line take and topic tags. Entries are
derived data: they are deleted with their source observation, never replace the
observation as evidence, and an UNKNOWN call is never replayed. Chat may cite the most
recent judged entries as her own earlier impressions. Interest rebuilds her views from these
entries; an owner-withdrawn entry stops counting and is never judged again.

Owner decision 2026-10-29: model judgement on, retention follows the source, she may
mention these unprompted, Heybox posts included.
