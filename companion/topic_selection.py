"""Interest-driven discovery: choose what a discover request searches for.

Owner decisions 2026-10-29 (`.local/design-drafts/interest-topic-selection.md`): 60% of
discover runs search one interest, 40% keep the original discovery; her own interests
come from the watch ledger, and the owner's confirmed private preferences may be used
as search terms (the term then goes to the platform under her account). Heybox keeps
its fixed topic rotation for now; a source joins by registering in QUERY_SOURCES.

No model call and no new state: interests are a projection over the watch ledger and
memories, and rotation reads earlier discover requests.
