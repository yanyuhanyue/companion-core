"""Local status of QQ reply quotes: erased, forgotten or recalled sources stay withdrawn.

The Bridge reads a quoted message from QQ, which does not know about Core erasure or
owner recall. The signed capture is left unchanged so replay still verifies; only what
reaches the model is withdrawn. Lookups stay in the current conversation and protocol
epoch namespace, and a reference that matches no local row is left as the Bridge read it.
