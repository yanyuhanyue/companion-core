"""Hold owner frames received while Core was unreachable; admit them only after Core is back.

A held frame is not a capture: it has no signature, no inbox row and no reference or media
read, and nothing reaches Core from it. The table keeps the original frame with its real
receive time and peer; the Bridge journal records only hashes (`INPUT_HELD`). Once Core
answers again the oldest frame is prepared on the live path with that original receive
time (authority check, recall check, reference reads, signature, inbox), so Core still
applies its own 30 s receive bound, authority activation time, policy expiry, recall,
erasure and retention checks. Every held frame ends in one `INPUT_HOLD_CLOSED` record:

- PROMOTED: captured as an ordinary `authenticated_onebot_ws` input;
- DUPLICATE: the same message was already captured another way (live or backfill);
- REJECTED: with a reason code (held too long, recalled, Core refused, OWNER STOP, ...).

The frame text is deleted when the hold closes. While any frame is held, newer frames are
held behind it so the owner's order is kept.
